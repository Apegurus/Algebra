# AlgebraPoolBase


Algebra pool base abstract contract

Contains state variables, immutables and common internal functions

*Developer note: Decoupling into a separate abstract contract simplifies testing*

## Modifiers
### onlyValidTicks

```solidity
modifier onlyValidTicks(int24 bottomTick, int24 topTick)
```

Check that the lower and upper ticks do not violate the boundaries of allowed ticks and are specified in the correct order

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| bottomTick | int24 |  |
| topTick | int24 |  |


## Structs
### GlobalState



```solidity
struct GlobalState {
  uint160 price;
  int24 tick;
  uint16 fee;
  uint8 pluginConfig;
  uint16 communityFee;
  bool unlocked;
}
```


## Variables
### address factory immutable

The Algebra factory contract, which must adhere to the IAlgebraFactory interface


### address token0 immutable

The first of the two tokens of the pool, sorted by address


### address token1 immutable

The second of the two tokens of the pool, sorted by address


### address communityVault immutable

The contract to which community fees are transferred


### uint256 totalFeeGrowth0Token 

The fee growth as a Q128.128 fees of token0 collected per unit of liquidity for the entire life of the pool

*Developer note: This value can overflow the uint256*

### uint256 totalFeeGrowth1Token 

The fee growth as a Q128.128 fees of token1 collected per unit of liquidity for the entire life of the pool

*Developer note: This value can overflow the uint256*

### struct AlgebraPoolBase.GlobalState globalState 

The globalState structure in the pool stores many values but requires only one slot
and is exposed as a single method to save gas when accessed externally.


### mapping(int24 &#x3D;&gt; struct TickManagement.Tick) ticks 

Look up information about a specific tick in the pool


### uint32 communityFeeLastTimestamp 

The timestamp of the last sending of tokens to community vault


### address plugin 

Returns the address of currently used plugin

*Developer note: The plugin is subject to change*

### mapping(int16 &#x3D;&gt; uint256) tickTable 

Returns 256 packed tick initialized boolean values. See TickTree for more information


### int24 nextTickGlobal 

The next initialized tick after current global tick


### int24 prevTickGlobal 

The previous initialized tick before (or at) current global tick


### uint128 liquidity 

The currently in range liquidity available to the pool

*Developer note: This value has no relationship to the total liquidity across all ticks.
Returned value cannot exceed type(uint128).max*

### int24 tickSpacing 

The current tick spacing

*Developer note: Ticks can only be initialized by new mints at multiples of this value
e.g.: a tickSpacing of 60 means ticks can be initialized every 60th tick, i.e., ..., -120, -60, 0, 60, 120, ...
However, tickspacing can be changed after the ticks have been initialized.
This value is an int24 to avoid casting even though it is always positive.*


## Functions
### maxLiquidityPerTick

```solidity
function maxLiquidityPerTick() external pure returns (uint128)
```

The maximum amount of position liquidity that can use any tick in the range

*Developer note: This parameter is enforced per tick to prevent liquidity from overflowing a uint128 at any point, and
also prevents out-of-range liquidity from being used to prevent adding in-range liquidity to a pool*

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| [0] | uint128 | The max amount of liquidity per tick |

### getCommunityFeePending

```solidity
function getCommunityFeePending() external view returns (uint128, uint128)
```

The amounts of token0 and token1 that will be sent to the vault

*Developer note: Will be sent COMMUNITY_FEE_TRANSFER_FREQUENCY after communityFeeLastTimestamp*

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| [0] | uint128 |  |
| [1] | uint128 |  |

### fee

```solidity
function fee() external view returns (uint16 currentFee)
```

The current pool fee value

*Developer note: In case dynamic fee is enabled in the pool, this method will call the plugin to get the current fee.
If the plugin implements complex fee logic, this method may return an incorrect value or revert.
In this case, see the plugin implementation and related documentation.*

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| currentFee | uint16 | The current pool fee value in hundredths of a bip, i.e. 1e-6 |
