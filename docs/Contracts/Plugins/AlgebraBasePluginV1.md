# AlgebraBasePluginV1


Algebra default plugin

This contract stores timepoints and calculates adaptive fee and statistical averages

## Modifiers
### onlyPool

```solidity
modifier onlyPool()
```




## Variables
### bytes32 FEE_CONFIG_MANAGER constant



*Developer note: The role can be granted in AlgebraFactory*

### uint8 defaultPluginConfig constant

Returns plugin config


### address pool immutable

Returns the address of the pool the plugin is created for


### struct VolatilityOracle.Timepoint[65536] timepoints 

Returns data belonging to a certain timepoint

*Developer note: There is more convenient function to fetch a timepoint: getTimepoints(). Which requires not an index but seconds*

### uint16 timepointIndex 

Returns the index of the last timepoint that was written.


### uint32 lastTimepointTimestamp 

Returns the timestamp of the last timepoint that was written.


### address incentive 

Returns the address of active incentive

*Developer note: if there is no active incentive at the moment, incentiveAddress would be equal to address(0)*

### struct AlgebraFeeConfiguration feeConfig 

Current dynamic fee configuration

*Developer note: See the AdaptiveFee struct for more details*


## Functions
### constructor

```solidity
constructor(address _pool, address _factory, address _pluginFactory) public
```



| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| _pool | address |  |
| _factory | address |  |
| _pluginFactory | address |  |

### initialize

```solidity
function initialize() external
```

Initialize the plugin externally

*Developer note: This function allows to initialize the plugin if it was created after the pool was created*

### getSingleTimepoint

```solidity
function getSingleTimepoint(uint32 secondsAgo) external view returns (int56 tickCumulative, uint112 volatilityCumulative)
```



*Developer note: Reverts if a timepoint at or before the desired timepoint timestamp does not exist.
0 may be passed as &#x60;secondsAgo&#x27; to return the current cumulative values.
If called with a timestamp falling between two timepoints, returns the counterfactual accumulator values
at exactly the timestamp between the two timepoints.*

| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| tickCumulative | int56 | The cumulative tick since the pool was first initialized, as of `secondsAgo` |
| volatilityCumulative | uint112 | The cumulative volatility value since the pool was first initialized, as of `secondsAgo` |

### getTimepoints

```solidity
function getTimepoints(uint32[] secondsAgos) external view returns (int56[] tickCumulatives, uint112[] volatilityCumulatives)
```

Returns the accumulator values as of each time seconds ago from the given time in the array of &#x60;secondsAgos&#x60;

*Developer note: Reverts if &#x60;secondsAgos&#x60; &gt; oldest timepoint*

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| secondsAgos | uint32[] | Each amount of time to look back, in seconds, at which point to return a timepoint |

### prepayTimepointsStorageSlots

```solidity
function prepayTimepointsStorageSlots(uint16 startIndex, uint16 amount) external
